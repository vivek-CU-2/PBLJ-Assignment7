🚀 Experiment 7: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

📌 Objective

The objective of this experiment is to explore JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for connecting and interacting with relational databases in Java. Students will implement solutions to given problems of varying difficulty levels to strengthen their understanding of database handling, CRUD operations, and MVC architecture.

📜 Assignment Details

The assignment consists of three problems: Easy, Medium, and Hard levels. Each question is designed to enhance your understanding of JDBC, SQL queries, and database transaction management.

🟢 Easy Level: Fetch Data from a MySQL Database

Problem Statement:

Create a Java program to connect to a MySQL database and fetch data from a single table.

The program should:

Use DriverManager and Connection objects.

Retrieve and display all records from a table named Employee with columns EmpID, Name, and Salary.

Expected Learning Outcomes:

Connecting Java with MySQL using JDBC.

Executing SELECT queries.

Fetching and displaying database records.

📍 Hint: Use ResultSet and Statement to execute SQL queries.

🟡 Medium Level: CRUD Operations on a Database Table

Problem Statement:

Build a Java program to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database table Product with columns:

ProductID

ProductName

Price

Quantity

The program should include:

Menu-driven options for each CRUD operation.

Transaction handling to ensure data integrity.

Expected Learning Outcomes:

Implementing INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries in Java.

Using PreparedStatement for parameterized queries.

Implementing transaction management with commit() and rollback().

📍 Hint: Use Scanner for input and try-catch-finally for handling exceptions.

🔴 Hard Level: Student Management System using JDBC and MVC

Problem Statement:

Develop a Java application using JDBC and MVC architecture to manage student data.

The application should:

Use a Student class as the model with fields:

StudentID

Name

Department

Marks

Include a database table to store student data.

Allow users to perform CRUD operations through a simple menu-driven view.

Implement database operations in a separate controller class.

Expected Learning Outcomes:

Understanding MVC architecture in Java applications.

Implementing modular database handling using a controller class.

Performing CRUD operations efficiently using JDBC.

📢 Happy Coding! 🚀
